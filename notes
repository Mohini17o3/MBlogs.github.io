---- Controllers -----

routers and controllers enable structured handling of requests and responses in an application , the routers map incoming HTTP requests to specific endpoints , while controllers receive the requests from routers , process business logic , interact with database ,return appropriate responses to client

we need controllers for ??

# authentication as I want authenticated users to comment

# comment controller

# post controller , for dynamic post display on homepage

# and three routes for all these three

------ JWT Structure -------
three parts :

1. Header : contains metadata about type of token , and signing algorithm used .
2. Payload : contains claims , which are statements about an entity and additional data .
3. signature : created by signing the encoded header and payload with a secret key .
   JWT looks like : header.payload.signature

NOTE :
when JWT is created , the signature is generated by taking he encoded header and payload , then using the secret key and the specified algorithm to create a hash . This hash becomes signature part of the token

TOKEN VERIFICATION
token received from incomng request , extract the token from request header , jwt.verify , takes token and secret key which decoded token to retrieve header and payload , recreated signature by hashing the header and payload with same secret used to sign the token originally , newly created signature is compared with signature part of received token ;

if signature matches , token is valid , data not altred , else invalid
