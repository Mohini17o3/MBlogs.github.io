                A while ago , one of my friends asked me a question , we were just casually talking , actually playing this game called truth and dare , its a little stupid game atleast for me ,I would never do a dare and the questions that are asked I doubt I would ever answer truthfully ðŸ’€

            It literally feels like a writing a diary now, to some extent. The difference being I maintain boundaries here of not pouring out all my thoughts, at least not directly, hehehe. I just resumed reading a book I have been stuck with since last year, yup that's the level of procrastination
