     <h3>LIVE IN THE PRESENTTT</h3>
    <h4>July 7 , 2024</h4>
<p>
   Past few days , I have been feeling so troubled , its like the old days , the JEE days but I'm in a better condition now , anyway , I had that feeling of continuous stress and irritation due to that, I had so many things to think about , and I could not focus at all 
</p>
Sometimes we just forget the basic thing right , like we all know that we should live in the present , we all say this but are we able to implement this , are we able to calm ourselves in stressful situations , are we able to analyse our thought process and figure out what exactly is troubling us and figure out a solution and make that call for action ? I forget to do it frequently , I do remember it but I forget to implement it , recently I just forgot to live in the present moment , to focus on what I am doing right now , I was doing something and worrying about the other .
<p>
This is what I did 3 years back , I had forgotten to live in the present , I had forgotten to look and pay attention to what is in front of me , at that time I was always worried about the "what ifs" , my perspective went to paying attention to what was going wrong and anticipating about what else might go wrong , the situations I had no control on did affect me , they did take me to the downside but the next call to action by my brain would have decided what else could go wrong , and it did decide that , I can say there is always some luck factor but only if we are mentally strong to face it , wouldn't the end result depend mostly on us ?? On what we decide to do ðŸ¤” . Even though we face it and might not get the result as much as we wanted but atleast something , and atleast we would have been satisfied with the fact that we faced such a situation and didn't dwell into sadness and fear .   
</p>


<p>
    Anyways the good thing is , based on my past experience , I atleast now can make that CTA to stop my brain to overthink , and get myself back on track and start focusing on what is in front of me , focusing on things one at a time , doing tasks one at a time . By the way , I started watching Haikyu AGAIN , I never get bored of it , everytime I watch it , I feel the same excitement with every spike , with every recieve , it is just that good , apart from that it just motivates me hella lot , you can just relate with it sooo much . Sometimes when I think about what is something that I could change by going back in time (its not just a single thing though) , I would make myself learn some sport , probably volleyball , it just teaches you a lot in many ways , most importantly the fact that you are not always going to win and how you react to failure is going to decide your next result ...
 <br><br>

 I can write more about haikyu here and how much I admire and learn from it , but let's save it for next post , also I need to work on this website too ...see ..again so many things to do , but I have to focus on ONE at a time .
