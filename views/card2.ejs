    I try to keep myself busy ...yup I am an escapist mostly,  trying to escape how I feel  about certain things, about things that make me emotionally weak , I feel like I don't have much time to pay heed to this you know , so I try to escape that by making myself busy , I think this is the reason that I quote prone to procrastination , its like when I have so much work to do , so much stress , and it causes discomfort I try to escape that by wasting time even though I am not happy doing that , even though it make me feel even worse after, but for that period I have escaped , anyways I don't really do that much as I analyse a lot sometimes , I analyse my behaviour and my actions , always trying to dig out some pattern or some reason that compels few of my actions, you see , I am an overthinker ...

</p>
<p>
    Keeping myself busy was the sole reason that I joined some music training , so that at least for an hour in the day , I have some time with myself , I have sometime where I can forget about other things , the other reason was to open up , because I am not good socially , and being an introvert nerd in school with 1 year at home for JEE , had made me a social anxiety ridden lad , I wanted to change that , and thanks to it , for an hour although in alternative days , I get a context switch from the stress , and I love that time , and I always try to never skip it . 
</p>
<p>I am sure I am not the only person wanting to pursue so many things  , having sooo many hobbies and all so different from each other , I hope with time I get to do all of them , atleast I would be satisfied with myself .</p>
<p> That's it , the trail of my thoughts ended , by the way , this was an escape too. ðŸ¤§</p>
